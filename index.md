  # Hobbies & Interests 
  I am the go-to IT / Tech support for my family when they have technical issues. I enjoy video gaming to wind down as well and spending time with my young family, making memories. I would describe myself as an amateur home cook as I enjoy cooking meals from scratch as well as eating out and trying new foods.
